## Motivation

This project was doing along with the Alzheimer Disease project of mine. I'm considering it as a extra one for me to test my skill set. The dataset in this project was shared by Rabie El Kharoua, He's definitely a master of datasets on Kaggle. I see that all the dataset was shared by now was documented very well, and with high applicable in reality. Not a big deal but you can find him via the dataset link I tagged above. Peace
